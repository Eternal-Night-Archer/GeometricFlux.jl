# Random Graphs

## Random Graph Generation

A graph is needed as input for a GNN model. Random graph can be generated, which is provided by Graphs.jl package. A random graph can be generated by `erdos_renyi` model.

```julia
julia> using Graphs

julia> g = erdos_renyi(10, 30)
{10, 30} undirected simple Int64 graph
```

To construct a `FeaturedGraph` object, just put the graph object and its corresponding features into it.

```julia
julia> X = rand(Float32, 5, 10);

julia> fg = FeaturedGraph(g, nf=X)
FeaturedGraph:
	Undirected graph with (#V=10, #E=30) in adjacency matrix
	Node feature:	‚Ñù^5 <Matrix{Float32}>
```

Various random graph with different generating model can be used here.

```julia
julia> barabasi_albert(10, 3)
{10, 21} undirected simple Int64 graph

julia> watts_strogatz(10, 4, 0.3)
{10, 20} undirected simple Int64 graph
```

`barabasi_albert` generates graphs from scale-free network model, while `watts_strogatz` generates graphs from small-world model.


## Common Graphs

There are commonly used graphs listed here.

```julia
clique_graph(k, n)
complete_graph(n)
grid(dims; periodic=false)
path_digraph(n)
path_graph(n)
```
